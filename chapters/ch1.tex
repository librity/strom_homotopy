\item The category $\mathbf{Sets}$ of sets and functions between them.
\item Given a unital ring $R$, we have the category $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ of left $R$-modules and $R$-module homomorphisms. Similarly, we also have the categories of right $R$-modules $\mathbf{Mod}$-$R$ and $R$-$S$-bimodules $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$-$S$, for some other unital ring $S$.

As a special case, if $\F$ is a field, then $\F$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ is the category of vector spaces over $\F$ and $\F$-linear maps, sometimes denoted as $\mathbf{Vect}_{\F}$. 
\item Given a class $S$, we can form a category with objects the elements of $S$ and only identity morphisms. It is called the \emph{discrete category} with object class $S$. This includes the finite categories $\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{2},\ldots, \mathbf{n},\ldots,$ with objects the natural numbers up to $n$. Of course, we also have the empty category $\vn$ with no objects and no morphisms.  
\item Given a unital ring $R$, the category $\mathbf{Mat}(R)$ of matrices with entries in $R$ has the natural numbers $\N$ as objects, and for $n,m\in \mathbf{Mat}(R)$, the set of morphisms $\mor_{\mathbf{Mat}(R)}(n,m)$ is the set $\Mat_{m\times n}(R)$ of $m\times n$ matrices with entries in $R$.

The composite $B\circ A\cl n\to p$ of $A\cl n\to m$ and $B\cl m\to p$ is the product matrix $BA\in\Mat_{p\times n}(R)$ and the identity $\id_n\cl n\to n$ is just $I_n\in \Mat_{n\times n}(R)$. That these make $\mathbf{Mat}(R)$ into a category follows at once from the properties of matrix multiplication.

This is one of few examples in which a category is named after its morphisms rather than its objects.
\item The category $\mathbf{hTop}$, whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous maps. This is an example of a \emph{quotient category}.

In general, given a category $\mathcal{C}$, an \emph{equivalence relation} $\sim$ on $\mathcal{C}$ consists in an equivalence relation $\sim_{X,Y}$ on $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ for each pair of objects $X$ and $Y$ which respects composition. That is, given $f_1,f_2\in\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ and $g_1,g_2\in\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)$ such that $f_1\sim_{X,Y}f_2$ and $g_1\sim_{Y,Z}g_2$, we require that $g_1\circ f_1\sim_{X,Z}g_2\circ f_2$. We can then define $\mathcal{C}/{\sim}$ by setting $\ob(\mathcal{C}/{\sim})=\ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mor_{\mathcal{C}/{\sim}}(X,Y)=\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/{\sim_{X,Y}}$. 
\een
\item Given a group $G$, define a category $\mathcal{G}$ by setting $\ob(\mathcal{G})=\{*\}$. Then $\mathcal{G}$ has a single morphism set and we can declare $\mor_{\mathcal{G}}(*,*)=G$ and define composition of morphisms in $\mor_{\mathcal{G}}(*,*)$ to be the binary operation of $G$. The associativity and identity axioms of $G$ imply that $\mathcal{G}$ is a category. 

The same construction works just as well even if $G$ is just a monoid. The existence of inverses in the group $G$ implies that every morphism in $\mor_{\mathcal{G}}(*,*)$ is an equivalence.

Vice versa, given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with only one object $*$, the axioms in the definition of a category imply that $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)$ is a monoid under composition of morphisms. If, in addition, every morphism in $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)$ is an equivalence, then $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)$ is a group under $\circ$.

So monoids and groups are exactly the same as categories with one object and categories with one object in which every morphism is an equivalence, respectively.
\item Let $a,b,c\in X$ and let $\omega\cl a\to b$ and $\gamma\cl b\to c$ be paths in $X$ with $\omega\cl[0,d_1]\to X$ and $\gamma\cl[0,d_2]\to X$, respectively. We define the composite $\gamma\circ \omega\cl a\to c$ to be $\omega * \gamma  \cl [0,d_1+d_2] \to  X$, where 
\bse
(\omega*\gamma) (t) = \begin{cases}\omega(t), &0\leq t\leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t \leq d_1+d_2 .\end{cases}
\ese
For any $a\in X$, we define $\id_a\cl a \to a$ by $\id_a\cl [0,0]\to X$, with $\id_a(0)=a$. Then $\omega\circ \id_a=\omega=\id_b\circ\omega$ for any $\omega\cl a\to b$.

Finally, given $\omega\cl a\to b$, $\gamma\cl b\to c$ and $\eta\cl c\to d$, we have
\bi{rCl}
\eta\circ(\gamma\circ \omega) & = & (\omega * \gamma)*\eta\\
& = & \left( t\mapsto \begin{cases}\omega(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t\leq d_1+d_2\end{cases} \right)\! * \eta\\
& = & t\mapsto \begin{cases}\omega(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t\leq d_1+d_2\\ \eta(t-d_1-d_2),&d_1+d_2\leq t\leq d_1+d_2+d_3\end{cases}
\ei
and
\bi{rCl}
(\eta\circ\gamma)\circ \omega & = & \omega * (\gamma*\eta)\\
& = & \omega * \! \left( t\mapsto \begin{cases}\gamma(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_2\\ \eta(t-d_2), & d_2\leq t\leq d_2+d_3\end{cases} \right)\\
& = & t\mapsto \begin{cases}\omega(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t\leq d_2+d_1\\ \eta(t-d_2-d_1),&d_2+d_1\leq t\leq d_2+d_3+d_1,\end{cases}
\ei
so $\eta\circ(\gamma\circ \omega) =(\eta\circ\gamma)\circ \omega$.

\bse
(g\circ f)\circ (f^{-1}\circ g^{-1})=g\circ (f\circ f^{-1})\circ g^{-1}=g\circ g^{-1}=\id_Z

and
\bse
(f^{-1}\circ g^{-1})\circ (g\circ f)= f^{-1} \circ (g^{-1}\circ g) \circ f=f^{-1} \circ f=\id_X.

So $g\circ f\cl X\to Z$ is an equivalence with inverse $(g\circ f)^{-1}=f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$. Thus $X\sim Y$ and $Y\sim Z$ imply $X\sim Z$.

Let $h\cl X\to Y$ be a left inverse to $g$. Then $g\circ f=\id_X$ and $h\circ g=\id_Y$. We have

Whenever we use the term `retract', we should be referring to the definition above, where an object $A$ was a retract of another object $X$ in some category. By setting up an appropriate category, show that our definition of $f$ being a retract of $g$ can be thought of as an instance of that general categorical definition. What is does it mean, in terms of the category $\mathcal{C}$, for two objects to be equivalent in your new category?

{\scshape Hint}. Obviously, $f$ and $g$ must be among the objects in your category!
\ex

\bs
Fix a category $\mathcal{C}$ and let $\mathcal{M}$ be the category with objects the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, so $f\in \ob(\mathcal{M})$ if $f\in \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ for some $A,B\in \ob(\mathcal{C})$.

A morphism from $A\xrightarrow{f}B$ to $X\xrightarrow{g}Y$ is a pair of morphisms $(A\xrightarrow{i}X,B\xrightarrow{j}Y)$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that the square
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
A \ar[d,"f"]\ar[r,"i"]& X\ar[d,"g"]\\
B\ar[r,"j"] & Y
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commutes, i.e.\ $j\circ f=g\circ i$.

If $f\cl A\to B$, the identity $\id_f\cl f\to f$ is given by $\id_f=(\id_A,\id_B)$ and if $(i,j)\cl f\to g$ and $(k,l)\cl g\to h$ are morphisms in $\mathcal{M}$, their composite is defined by
\bse
(k,l)\circ (i,j)=(k\circ i,l\circ j) \cl f\to h.
\ese
With these definitions, the associativity and identity laws in $\mathcal{M}$ follow directly from those of $\mathcal{C}$.

The categorical definition of a retract in $\mathcal{M}$ reads as: `$f$ is a retract of $g$ if there is a commutative diagram'
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
f \ar[rr,bend left=45,"\id_f"]\ar[r,"{(i,j)}"'] & g \ar[r,"{(r,s)}"'] & f 
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
Writing all morphisms explicitly, if $f\cl A\to B$ and $g\cl X\to Y$, we have
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
A \ar[d,"f"]\ar[rr,bend left=45,"\id_A"]\ar[r,"i"] & X \ar[r,"r"] \ar[d,"g"]& A\ar[d,"f"]\\
B \ar[r,"j"] \ar[rr,bend right=45,"\id_B"] & Y\ar[r,"s"] & B

(r\circ g^{-1}\circ j)\circ f = r\circ g^{-1}\circ (j\circ f) = r\circ g^{-1}\circ g\circ i = r\circ i=\id_A.

Let $F \cl \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be a functor. Show that if $f \cl X \to Y$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{C}$, then $F(f)$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{D}$. Is it possible for $F(f)$ to be an equivalence without $f$ being an equivalence?
\ep

\bs
Let $f^{-1}\cl Y\to X$ be the inverse to $f$. Then $F(f^{-1})\cl FY\to FX$, so we can compose it with $F(f)\cl FX\to FY$. By the definition of functor, we have
\bse
F(f^{-1})\circ F(f)=F(f^{-1}\circ f)=F(\id_X)=\id_{FX}
\ese
and
\bse
F(f)\circ F(f^{-1})=F(f\circ f^{-1})=F(\id_Y)=\id_{FY}.
\ese
So $F(f)$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{D}$ and, moreover, $F(f^{-1})=F(f)^{-1}$.

Consider the finite category with two objects $a,b$ and only one non-identity morphism $f\cl a\to b$. Since there are no morphisms $b\to a$, $f$ is not an equivalence. The (unique) functor into the category $\mathbf{1}$ with a single object and a single morphism (namely, the identity on that object) maps $f$ to an equivalence.

Let $G$ be a group, and think of it as a category with one object, as in Exercise 1.3. Interpret functors $F \cl G \to \mathbf{Sets}$ in terms of familiar concepts in algebra.

\bs
A functor $F \cl G \to \mathbf{Sets}$ consists of a map $\{*\}\to \ob(\mathbf{Sets})$, i.e.\ a choice of a set $F(*)=X$, together with a map $F(g)\cl X\to X$ for each $g\in G$ such that $F(e)=\id_X$ (where $e$ is the identity of $G$) and $F(g\cdot h)=F(g)\circ F(h)$ for all $g,h\in G$. In other words, $F$ is the same as a $G$-set.

Explicitly, we get an action of $G$ on $X$ by defining

As $f_*\cl \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,A)\to \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ is a bijection, we must have $g\circ f=\id_A$. So $f$ is an equivalence.

But by the universal properties of $P$ and $Q$, the unique morphisms $P\to P$ and $Q\to Q$ satisfying the above equations are $\id_P$ and $\id_Q$, respectively. Hence, $f$ and $g$ are equivalences.

is a product of $X\times Y$ and $Z$. Then it will follow that $(X\times Y)\times Z$ exists and, by the universal property, $X\times (Y\times Z)\cong (X\times Y)\times Z$.

commute. We need to show that it is the unique such morphism. Let $\widetilde h\cl A \to X\times (Y\times Z)$ be another morphism making the above diagram commute, i.e.\
\bi{rCl}
(\pr_X,\pr_Y\circ\pr_{Y\times Z})\circ\widetilde h&=&f\\
(\pr_Z\circ\pr_{Y\times Z})\circ\widetilde h&=&g.
\ei
Then, as $f=(\pr_X'\circ f,\pr_Y'\circ f)$, we have $\pr_X\circ \widetilde h=\pr_X'\circ f$. Furthermore, $\pr_Y\circ\pr_{Y\times Z}\circ \widetilde h=\pr_Y'\circ f$ together with the second equation above, imply that $\pr_{Y\times Z}\circ \widetilde h=(\pr_Y'\circ f,g)$. Hence $\widetilde h$ also makes the earlier diagram commute. But $h$ is the unique morphism making that diagram commute and thus $\widetilde h=h$.

An entirely analogous argument shows that if $(X\times Y)\times Z$ exists, then so does $X\times (Y\times Z)$, and $(X\times Y)\times Z\cong X\times (Y\times Z)$.

By definition of the diagonal map, the top and bottom sections commute and, by definition of $f\times f$, so does the right square. We thus have

\pr_Y^1\circ\Delta\circ f & = & \id_Y\circ f = f.

By replacing $\pr_X^1$ and $\pr_Y^1$ with $\pr_X^2$ and $\pr_Y^2$, respectively, in the above diagram, we also obtain $\pr_Y^2\circ (f\times f)\circ \Delta =f$ and $\pr_Y^2\circ\Delta\circ f = f$. So both $(f\times f)\circ \Delta$ and $\Delta\circ f$ make the first diagram commute, and thus

\end{tikzcd}
\ese
The top section commutes by definition of $\Delta$, and the square commutes by definition of $\pr_X\times\pr_Y$. We thus have
\bse
\pr_X\circ(\pr_X\times\pr_Y)\circ \Delta=\pr_X\circ\pr_{X\times Y}^1\circ\Delta=\pr_X\circ\id=\pr_X.

By replacing $\pr_X$ and $\pr_{X\times Y}^1$ in the above diagram with $\pr_Y$ and $\pr_{X\times Y}^2$, respectively, we also obtain

\item Given any set $X$, there is a unique map $\vn \to X$. 

Indeed, if a function $f\cl A\to B$ is defined to be a subset $f\subseteq A\times B$ such that for all $a\in A$ there is a unique $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in f$, then clearly $\vn \subseteq \vn \times X=\vn$ satisfies this condition vacuously for any $X$ (including the case $\vn\to\vn$) and it is the unique subset of $\vn$.

So $\vn$ is an initial object of $\mathbf{Sets}$ and, in fact, the unique such.
Note, however, that there is no function $Y\to \vn$ for non-empty $Y$ since the above existence condition fails. Hence $\vn$ cannot be a terminal object.

Instead, a terminal object of $\mathbf{Sets}$ is any singleton $\{x\}$ as, given any other set $Y$, there is a unique map $Y\to \{x\}$, namely, the constant map with value $x$. Of course, there are infinitely many terminal objects in $\mathbf{Sets}$, but since there is a unique map between any two singletons which is, obviously, a bijection, the terminal object of $\mathbf{Sets}$ is unique up to unique isomorphism.
\item The empty space $\vn$ with its unique topology $\{\vn\}$ is such that the unique map $\vn\to X$ to any topological space $X$ is continuous. So $(\vn,\{\vn\})$ is the (unique) initial object in $\mathbf{Top}$.

Similarly, any one-point space $P$ with its unique topology $\{\vn,P\}$ is such that the unique map $Y\to P$ for any topological space $Y$ is continuous. So $(P,\{\vn,P\})$ is a terminal object of $\mathbf{Top}$.

\item The trivial group $\{e\}$ in $\mathbf{Grp}$, which is unique up to unique group isomorphism, is the zero object of $\mathbf{Grp}$, i.e.\ it is both initial and terminal.    
Indeed, given any other group $G$, there is a unique homomorphism $G\to \{e\}$ (the unique set function $G\to \{e\}$) and a unique homomorphism $\{e\} \to G$, i.e.\ the function mapping $e$ to the identity element of $G$.

Verify that $\mathbf{Sets_*}$ is a pointed category. What is a sum in $\mathbf{Sets_*}$? What is a product?
\ex

\bs
Any pointed singleton $(\{x\},x)$ is a zero object of $\mathbf{Sets_*}$. Indeed, given any other pointed set $(Y,y)$, there is a unique pointed map $(Y,y)\to(\{x\},x)$ (the unique map $Y\to \{x\}$) and a unique pointed map $(\{x\},x)\to (Y,y)$ sending $x\mapsto y$.

The sum of $(X,x_0)$ and $(Y,y_0)$ in $\mathbf{Sets _*}$ is $(X\sqcup Y/\{x_0,y_0\},[x_0]=[y_0])$ with the usual injections, while their product is $(X\times Y,(x_0,y_0))$ with the usual projections. Indeed, given any pointed maps $f\cl(X,x_0)\to(Z,z_0)$ and $g\cl(Y,y_0)\to(Z,z_0)$, there is a unique map $h\cl X\sqcup Y\to Z$ such that $h\circ\inj_X=f$ and $h\circ\inj_Y=g$. Then, in particular, 
\bse
h(x_0)=h(\inj_X(x_0))=f(x_0)=z_0=g(y_0)=h(\inj_Y(y_0))=h(y_0).
\ese
So $h$ is, in fact, a well-defined pointed map $(X\sqcup Y/\{x_0,y_0\},[x_0])\to(Z,z_0)$, and the unique such making the diagram

&(Z,z_0)&
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commute. Dually, given any pointed maps $f\cl(Z,z_0)\to(X,x_0)$ and $g\cl(Z,z_0)\to(Y,y_0)$, there is a unique map $h\cl Z\to X\times Y$ such that $\pr_X\circ h=f$ and $\pr_Y\circ h=g$. Then, in particular, 
\bse
\pr_X(h(z_0))=f(z_0)=x_0 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \pr_Y(h(z_0))=g(z_0)=y_0,

so $h(z_0)=(x_0,y_0)$. Thus $h$ is indeed the unique pointed map making the following diagram commute.

For $A\in \mathcal{C}$ and $B\in\mathcal{D}$, denote by $\Phi_{A,B}\cl\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(FA,B)\to\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,GB)$ and $\Psi_{A,B}\cl\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(F'A,B)\to\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,GB)$ the natural bijections corresponding to the adjunctions $F\dashv G$ and $F'\dashv G$, respectively.

For each $A\in \mathcal{C}$, define $\xi_A=(\Psi_{A,FA})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,FA}(\id_{FA}))$, i.e.\ $\xi_A$ is the image of $\id_{FA}$ under the composite
\bse

Then $\xi\cl F'\to F$ is a natural isomorphism. To see this, let $f\cl A\to B$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$. We seek to show that the diagram

The internal squares commute by the assumption that we have adjunctions $F\dashv G$ and $F'\dashv G$. Hence, so does the outer rectangle. Following $\id_{FA}$ around the diagram, we obtain

Similarly, by considering the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge,column sep=4.5em]
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(FB,FB) \ar[r,"\Phi_{B,FB}"]\ar[d,"-\circ Ff"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B,GFB)\ar[r,"(\Psi_{B,FB})^{-1}"] \ar[d,"-\circ f"]& \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(F'B,FB)\ar[d,"-\circ F'f"]\\
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(FA,FB) \ar[r,"\Phi_{A,FB}"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,GFB)\ar[r,"(\Psi_{A,FB})^{-1}"] & \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(F'A,FB)
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
we find
\bi{rCl}
\xi_B\circ F'f & = & (\Psi_{A,FB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,FB}(\id_{FB}\circ Ff))\\
& = & (\Psi_{A,FB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,FB}(Ff)).
\ei
So $Ff\circ\xi_A=\xi_B\circ F'f$, i.e.\ $\xi$ is a natural transformation.

Finally, for each $A\in \mathcal{C}$, define $\lambda_A=(\Phi_{A,F'A})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,F'A}(\id_{F'A}))$, i.e.\ $\lambda_A$ is the image of $\id_{F'A}$ under the composite
\bse
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(F'A,F'A)\xrightarrow{\ \Psi_{A,F'A} \ }\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,GF'A)\xrightarrow{\ (\Phi_{A,F'A})^{-1}\ }\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(FA,F'A).
\ese
By the naturality of the bijections $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge,column sep=4.5em]
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(F'A,F'A) \ar[r,"\Psi_{A,F'A}"]\ar[d,"\xi_A\circ-"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,GF'A)\ar[r,"(\Phi_{A,F'A})^{-1}"] \ar[d," G\xi_A\circ-"]& \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(FA,F'A)\ar[d,"\xi_A\circ-"]\\
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(F'A,FA) \ar[r,"\Psi_{A,FA}"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,GFA)\ar[r,"(\Phi_{A,FA})^{-1}"] & \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(FA,FA)
\end{tikzcd}
\ese

commutes. Chasing $\id_{F'A}$ around the diagram, we obtain
\bi{rCl}
\xi_A\circ\lambda_A & = & (\Phi_{A,FA})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,FA}(\xi_A\circ \id_{F'A}))\\
& = & (\Phi_{A,FA})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,FA}(\xi_A))\\
& = &  (\Phi_{A,FA})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,FA}(\Psi_{A,FA})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,FA}(\id_{FA})))\\
& = &  (\Phi_{A,FA})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,FA}(\id_{FA}))\\
& = &\id_{FA}
\ei
and, similarly, $\lambda_A\circ\xi_A=\id_{F'A}$ for each $A\in \mathcal{C}$. So $\xi_A$ is an isomorphism for each $A\in\mathcal{C}$, and thus $\xi\cl F'\to F$ is a natural isomorphism with inverse $\lambda$.
