Show that $\mathcal{D}$ is commutative if, and only if, $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$ is commutative.

\bs
The commutativity of $\mathcal{D}$ amounts to the equality between one or more composites $f_n\circ\cdots \circ f_1=g_m\circ \cdots\circ g_1$. The diagram $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$ is formed by adding all the identity morphisms, which obviously do not change the composites, as well as all compositions of morphisms  already present in $\mathcal{D}$. These will be of the form $\widetilde f=f_{i+1}\circ f_i$ and thus, by associativity, also leave the above composites unchanged.

\item The category $\mathbf{Sets}$ of sets and functions between them.
\item Given a unital ring $R$, we have the category $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ of left $R$-modules and $R$-module homomorphisms. Similarly, we also have the categories of right $R$-modules $\mathbf{Mod}$-$R$ and $R$-$S$-bimodules $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$-$S$, for some other unital ring $S$.

As a special case, if $\F$ is a field, then $\F$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ is the category of vector spaces over $\F$ and $\F$-linear maps, sometimes denoted as $\mathbf{Vect}_{\F}$. 
\item Given a class $S$, we can form a category with objects the elements of $S$ and only identity morphisms. It is called the \emph{discrete category} with object class $S$. This includes the finite categories $\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{2},\ldots, \mathbf{n},\ldots,$ with objects the positive integers up to $1,2,\ldots,n,\ldots,$ respectively. Of course, we also have the empty category $\vn$ with no objects and no morphisms.  
\item Given a unital ring $R$, the category $\mathbf{Mat}(R)$ of matrices with entries in $R$ has the natural numbers $\N$ as objects, and for $n,m\in \mathbf{Mat}(R)$, the set of morphisms $\mor_{\mathbf{Mat}(R)}(n,m)$ is the set $\Mat_{m\times n}(R)$ of $m\times n$ matrices with entries in $R$.

The composite $B\circ A\cl n\to p$ of $A\cl n\to m$ and $B\cl m\to p$ is the product matrix $BA\in\Mat_{p\times n}(R)$ and the identity $\id_n\cl n\to n$ is just $I_n\in \Mat_{n\times n}(R)$. That these make $\mathbf{Mat}(R)$ into a category follows at once from the properties of matrix multiplication.

This is one of few examples in which a category is named after its morphisms rather than its objects.
\item The category $\mathbf{hTop}$, whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous maps. This is an example of a \emph{quotient category}.

In general, given a category $\mathcal{C}$, an \emph{equivalence relation} $\sim$ on $\mathcal{C}$ consists in an equivalence relation $\sim_{X,Y}$ on $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ for each pair of objects $X$ and $Y$ which respects composition. That is, given $f_1,f_2\in\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ and $g_1,g_2\in\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)$ such that $f_1\sim_{X,Y}f_2$ and $g_1\sim_{Y,Z}g_2$, we require that $g_1\circ f_1\sim_{X,Z}g_2\circ f_2$. We can then define $\mathcal{C}/{\sim}$ by setting $\ob(\mathcal{C}/{\sim})=\ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mor_{\mathcal{C}/{\sim}}(X,Y)=\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/{\sim_{X,Y}}$. 
\een
\item Given a group $G$, define a category $\mathcal{G}$ by setting $\ob(\mathcal{G})=\{*\}$. Then $\mathcal{G}$ has a single morphism set and we can declare $\mor_{\mathcal{G}}(*,*)=G$ and define composition of morphisms in $\mor_{\mathcal{G}}(*,*)$ to be the binary operation of $G$. The associativity and identity axioms of $G$ imply that $\mathcal{G}$ is a category. 

The same construction works just as well even if $G$ is just a monoid. The existence of inverses in the group $G$ implies that every morphism in $\mor_{\mathcal{G}}(*,*)$ is an equivalence.

Vice versa, given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with only one object $*$, the axioms in the definition of a category imply that $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)$ is a monoid under composition of morphisms. If, in addition, every morphism in $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)$ is an equivalence, then $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)$ is a group under $\circ$.

So monoids and groups are exactly the same as categories with one object and categories with one object in which every morphism is an equivalence, respectively.
\item Let $a,b,c\in X$ and let $\omega\cl a\to b$ and $\gamma\cl b\to c$ be paths in $X$ with $\omega\cl[0,d_1]\to X$ and $\gamma\cl[0,d_2]\to X$, respectively. We define the composite $\gamma\circ \omega\cl a\to c$ to be $\omega * \gamma  \cl [0,d_1+d_2] \to  X$, where 
\bse
(\omega*\gamma) (t) = \begin{cases}\omega(t), &0\leq t\leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t \leq d_1+d_2 .\end{cases}
\ese
For any $a\in X$, we define $\id_a\cl a \to a$ by $\id_a\cl [0,0]\to X$, with $\id_a(0)=a$. Then $\omega\circ \id_a=\omega=\id_b\circ\omega$ for any $\omega\cl a\to b$.

Finally, given $\omega\cl a\to b$, $\gamma\cl b\to c$ and $\eta\cl c\to d$, we have
\bi{rCl}
\eta\circ(\gamma\circ \omega) & = & (\omega * \gamma)*\eta\\
& = & \left( t\mapsto \begin{cases}\omega(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t\leq d_1+d_2\end{cases} \right)\! * \eta\\
& = & t\mapsto \begin{cases}\omega(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t\leq d_1+d_2\\ \eta(t-d_1-d_2),&d_1+d_2\leq t\leq d_1+d_2+d_3\end{cases}
\ei
and
\bi{rCl}
(\eta\circ\gamma)\circ \omega & = & \omega * (\gamma*\eta)\\
& = & \omega * \! \left( t\mapsto \begin{cases}\gamma(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_2\\ \eta(t-d_2), & d_2\leq t\leq d_2+d_3\end{cases} \right)\\
& = & t\mapsto \begin{cases}\omega(t), & 0\leq t \leq d_1\\ \gamma(t-d_1), & d_1\leq t\leq d_2+d_1\\ \eta(t-d_2-d_1),&d_2+d_1\leq t\leq d_2+d_3+d_1,\end{cases}
\ei
so $\eta\circ(\gamma\circ \omega) =(\eta\circ\gamma)\circ \omega$.
\item By construction, $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$ contains the identity morphism of each of its objects, as well as the composite of every pair of morphisms. The associativity axiom follows from the fact that $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$ is commutative.

\item The identity $\id_X$ is an equivalence, so $X\sim X$. If $f \cl X \to Y$ is an equivalence with inverse $f^{-1}$, then $f^{-1}\cl Y \to X$ is an equivalence with inverse $f$. So $X\sim Y$ implies $Y\sim X$. Finally, given equivalences $f \cl X \to Y$ and $g \cl Y \to Z$, we have
\bse
(g\circ f)\circ (f^{-1}\circ g^{-1})=g\circ (f\circ f^{-1})\circ g^{-1}=g\circ g^{-1}=\id_Z
\ese
and
\bse
(f^{-1}\circ g^{-1})\circ (g\circ f)= f^{-1} \circ (g^{-1}\circ g) \circ f=f^{-1} \circ f=\id_X.
\ese
So $g\circ f\cl X\to Z$ is an equivalence with inverse $(g\circ f)^{-1}=f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$. Thus $X\sim Y$ and $Y\sim Z$ imply $X\sim Z$.
\item 
\ben[label=(\roman*)]
\item In $\mathbf{Sets}$, the equivalences are precisely the bijections of sets. To see this, first note that the unique morphism $\vn \to \vn$ is an equivalence and that, if $A$ is non-empty, then there is no morphism $A\to\vn$, so the unique morphism $\vn \to A$ cannot be an equivalence (see Exercise 1.43 for more details). Thus, $\vn$ is equivalent only to itself.

Hence, suppose that $A$ and $X$ are non-empty. Then, if $f\cl A \to X$ is a bijection, its inverse $f^{-1}\cl X \to A$ is such that $f^{-1}\circ f=\id_A$ and $f\circ f^{-1}=\id_X$. Conversely, let $f\cl A \to X$ and suppose that there exists $g\cl X \to A$ such that $g\circ f=\id_A$ and $f\circ g=\id_X$. Let $a,b\in A$ be such that $f(a)=f(b)$. Since $g\circ f=\id_A$, we have $g(f(a))=g(f(b))$, hence $\id_A(a)=\id_A(b)$, so $a=b$ and $f$ is injective. Since $f\circ g=\id_X$, for every $x\in X$, we have $x=f(g(x))$. Thus, for all $x\in X$, there exists $a\in A$, namely $a=g(x)$, such that $f(a)=x$. So $f$ is surjective. Hence $f$ is a bijection.

In fact, more is true. A morphism $f\cl A \to X$ is injective if, and only if, there exists a $g\cl X \to A$ such that $g\circ f=\id_A$. Indeed, if $f$ is injective, then for all $x\in X$, the preimage $f^{-1}(\{x\})$ contains at most one element. We define $g\cl X\to A$ by
\bse
g(x)=\begin{cases}a & \text{ if }a\in f^{-1}(\{x\})\\ a_0 & \text{ if }f^{-1}(\{x\})=\vn,\end{cases}
\ese
where $a_0$ is any fixed element of $A$. Then, for each $a\in A$, we have $f^{-1}(\{f(a)\})=\{a\}$, so $(g\circ f)(a)=a$ for all $a\in A$, and thus $g\circ f=\id_A$.

Similarly, $f\cl A \to X$ is surjective if, and only if, there exists a $g\cl X \to A$ such that $f\circ g=\id_X$. Indeed, if $f$ is surjective, for each $x\in X$, the preimage $f^{-1}(\{x\})$ is non-empty. Thus (invoking the axiom of choice) we can define $g\cl X\to A$ by mapping each $x$ to any one element of $f^{-1}(\{x\})$ (i.e.\ we let $g$ be a choice function for the family $\{f^{-1}(\{x\})\mid x\in X\}$). Then, for each $x\in X$, we have $g(x)\in f^{-1}(\{x\})$ and hence $f(g(x))=x$ for all $x\in X$. Thus, $f\circ g=\id_X$.

%Therefore, a morphism in $\mathbf{Sets}$ is an equivalence in the sense of category theory if, and only if, it is a bijection. 
\item The $R$-module isomorphisms clearly satisfy the definition of equivalence in $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$. Recall that, if $f\cl M\to N$ is a bijective $R$-module homomorphism, then its inverse $f^{-1}$ (as a map of sets) is also an $R$-module homomorphism. Indeed, given $r\in R$ and $m_1,m_2\in M$, we have
\bi{rCl}
f(r\cdot f^{-1}(m_1)+f^{-1}(m_2)) & = & r\cdot f( f^{-1}(m_1))+f(f^{-1}(m_2))\\
& = & r \cdot m_1 + m_2\\
& = & f( f^{-1}(r \cdot m_1 + m_2))
\ei
and thus, since $f$ is injective, $f^{-1}(r \cdot m_1 + m_2)=r\cdot f^{-1}(m_1)+f^{-1}(m_2)$.
This, together with part (i), implies that the equivalences in $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ are precisely the $R$-module isomorphisms.

The situation is completely analogous with $\mathbf{Mod}$-$R$, $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$-$S$ and $\mathbf{Vect}_{\F}$, as well as $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{AbGrp}=\Z$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ (see Exercise A.1 for this equality).

\item In a discrete category, the only morphisms are the identity morphisms, and they are all equivalences. The converse is not true, however. That is, a category whose morphisms are all equivalences need not be a discrete category. Such categories are called \emph{groupoids}, and a groupoid with only a single object is a group in the sense of Exercise 1.3 (b).
\item A morphism $A\cl n\to m$ in $\mathbf{Mat}(R)$ is an equivalence if there exists $B\cl m\to n$ such that $BA=I_n$ and $AB=I_m$. If $R$ is commutative, then the trace operator (the sum of the diagonal entries) satisfies $\tr(XY)=\tr(YX)$ for any $X,Y\in \mathbf{Mat}(R)$ for which both $XY$ and $YX$ exist. Then, we have
\bse
m=\tr(I_m)=\tr(AB)=\tr(BA)=\tr(I_n)=n,
\ese
so every equivalence in $\mathbf{Mat}(R)$ with $R$ commutative must be an \emph{automorphism}, i.e.\ an invertible morphism with the same domain and target.
\item The equivalences in $\mathbf{Top}$ are continuous bijections whose inverses are also continuous, i.e.\ homeomorphisms. Note that, unlike the algebraic categories considered above, a continuous bijection in not necessarily a homeomorphism.

The equivalences in $\mathbf{hTop}$ are (homotopy classes of) homotopy equivalences, i.e.\ $[f]\cl X\to Y$ is an equivalence in $\mathbf{hTop}$ if there exists $g\cl Y \to X$ in $\mathbf{Top}$ such that $g\circ f$ is homotopic to $\id_X$ and $f\circ g$ is homotopic to $\id_Y$.
\een
The equivalences in a monoid $M$ seen as a category (Exercise 1.3 (b)) are simply the invertible elements of $M$, while in a groupoid every morphism is (by definition) an equivalence.

Finally, the category described in Exercise 1.3 (c) is an example of a \emph{skeletal category}, i.e.\ a category in which the only equivalences are the identity morphisms. Indeed, if $\omega\cl [0,d]\to X$ with $d>0$, it is clear that there exists no path $\gamma\cl [0,d']$ such that $\omega * \gamma$ or $\gamma * \omega$ is the identity, as this would require $d+d'=0$.

Let $h\cl X\to Y$ be a left inverse to $g$. Then $g\circ f=\id_X$ and $h\circ g=\id_Y$. We have

so $g\circ f=\id_X$ and $f\circ g=\id_Y$.

Whenever we use the term `retract', we should be referring to the definition above, where an object $A$ was a retract of another object $X$ in some category. By setting up an appropriate category, show that our definition of $f$ being a retract of $g$ can be thought of as an instance of that general categorical definition. What is does it mean, in terms of the category $\mathcal{C}$, for two objects to be equivalent in your new category?

{\scshape Hint}. Obviously, $f$ and $g$ must be among the objects in your category!
\ex

\bs
Fix a category $\mathcal{C}$ and let $\mathcal{M}$ be the category with objects the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, so $f\in \ob(\mathcal{M})$ if $f\in \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ for some $A,B\in \ob(\mathcal{C})$.

A morphism from $A\xrightarrow{f}B$ to $X\xrightarrow{g}Y$ is a pair of morphisms $(A\xrightarrow{i}X,B\xrightarrow{j}Y)$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that the square
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
A \ar[d,"f"]\ar[r,"i"]& X\ar[d,"g"]\\
B\ar[r,"j"] & Y
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commutes, i.e.\ $j\circ f=g\circ i$.

If $f\cl A\to B$, the identity $\id_f\cl f\to f$ is given by $\id_f=(\id_A,\id_B)$ and if $(i,j)\cl f\to g$ and $(k,l)\cl g\to h$ are morphisms in $\mathcal{M}$, their composite is defined by
\bse
(k,l)\circ (i,j)=(k\circ i,l\circ j) \cl f\to h.
\ese
With these definitions, the associativity and identity laws in $\mathcal{M}$ follow directly from those of $\mathcal{C}$.

The categorical definition of a retract in $\mathcal{M}$ reads as: `$f$ is a retract of $g$ if there is a commutative diagram'
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
f \ar[rr,bend left=45,"\id_f"]\ar[r,"{(i,j)}"'] & g \ar[r,"{(r,s)}"'] & f 
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
Writing all morphisms explicitly, if $f\cl A\to B$ and $g\cl X\to Y$, we have
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
A \ar[d,"f"]\ar[rr,bend left=45,"\id_A"]\ar[r,"i"] & X \ar[r,"r"] \ar[d,"g"]& A\ar[d,"f"]\\
B \ar[r,"j"] \ar[rr,bend right=45,"\id_B"] & Y\ar[r,"s"] & B
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
So the second definition given in the text is, in fact, an instance of the general categorical definition of a retract.

Finally, note that for $f\cl A\to B$ and $g\cl X\to Y$ to be equivalent in $\mathcal{M}$ it means that $A$ and $B$ are equivalent to $X$ and $Y$ via equivalences $i$ and $j$, respectively, which commute with $f$ and $g$.

Find examples of retracts in algebra, topology, and other contexts.
\ex

\bs
In the category $\mathbf{Grp}$, the trivial group $\{e\}$ is a retract of every other group as, for any group $G$, there are (unique) homomorphisms $\{e\} \to G \to \{e\}$, which compose to the identity on $\{e\}$. In general, a group $H$ is a retract of $G$ if, and only if, $H$ is (isomorphic to) a subgroup of $G$ which has a normal complement, i.e.\ a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$ such that $H\cap K=\{e\}$ and, for all $g\in G$, $g=hk$ for some $h\in H$, $k\in K$. Then $K$ is the kernel of the retraction $G\to H$.

In the category $\mathbf{Top}$, any one-point space $P$ is a retract of every other space. Indeed, for any space $X$, there are (unique) maps $X\to P$ and $P\to P$, so that $P\to X\to P$ is $\id_P$ for all maps $P\to X$. Retracts of a space retain some properties of that space, such as connectedness, but the converse is often false. There are several variants of this concept in topology, for instance that of a `deformation retraction', where in addition to $A\to X\to A$ being the identity on $A$, we also require that $X\to A\to X$ be homotopic to $\id_X$. A space $A$ is a retract of $X$ in $\mathbf{hTop}$ if $A$ is a `weak retract' of $X$ in $\mathbf{Top}$, i.e.\ if $A\to X\to A$ is homotopic to $\id_A$. 

In the category $\mathbf{Man}^{\infty}$ of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, if a smooth bundle $E\xrightarrow{\,\pi\,}M$ admits a global section $\sigma\cl M\to E$, then $M$ is a retract of $E$.

As a final note, we observe that if $\mathcal{C}$ has a terminal object $\tau$, then $\tau$ is a retract of every object in $\mathcal{C}$, as was the case for $\{e\}\in\mathbf{Grp}$ and $P\in\mathbf{Top}$.

\ben[label=(\alph*)]
\item Assuming that there is at most one morphism between any two objects in $\mathcal{D}$ to begin with, the diagram $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$ is formed by adding any identity morphisms not already present in $\mathcal{D}$, so $|\mor_{\overline{\mathcal{D}}}(X,X)|=1$ for each $X$ in $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$, and adding a morphism $X\to Y$ if there is no morphism $X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{D}$ but there are morphisms $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $f_n\circ\cdots\circ f_1\cl X\to Y$. Since $\mathcal{D}$ is commutative, all compositions resulting in a morphism $X\to Y$ are equal, so $|\mor_{\overline{\mathcal{D}}}(X,Y)|\leq 1$.

Conversely, suppose that $|\mor_{\overline{\mathcal{D}}}(X,Y)|\leq 1$ for all $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathcal{D}$. If there are morphisms $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $f_n\circ\cdots\circ f_1\cl X\to Y$, then $f_n\circ\cdots\circ f_1\in\mor_{\overline{\mathcal{D}}}(X,Y)$, so $|\mor_{\overline{\mathcal{D}}}(X,Y)|=1$. Given any other composite $g_m\circ\cdots\circ g_1\cl X\to Y$ of morphisms in $\mathcal{D}$, the fact that $|\mor_{\overline{\mathcal{D}}}(X,Y)|=1$ implies that $f_n\circ\cdots\circ f_1=g_m\circ\cdots\circ g_1$, so $\mathcal{D}$ is commutative.
\item Given a diagram in $\mathcal{A}$, the corresponding diagram in $\mathcal{B}$ has (not necessarily all distinct) objects $FX$ and morphisms $F(f)\cl FX\to FY$, with $X$, $Y$ and $f$ from the diagram in $\mathcal{A}$.

The commutativity of the diagram in $\mathcal{A}$ amounts to the equality of one or more composites $f_n\circ \cdots \circ f_1=g_m\circ \cdots \circ g_1\cl X\to Y$ between two objects $X,Y$ of the diagram. By functoriality, we have
\bse
F(f_n)\circ \cdots \circ F(f_1)=F(g_m)\circ \cdots \circ F(g_1)\cl FX\to FY,
\ese
so the corresponding diagram in $\mathcal{B}$ is also commutative.

Using the definition of an $\mathcal{I}$-shaped diagram in $\mathcal{A}$, given in Section 2.1, as simply a covariant functor $D\cl\mathcal{I}\to\mathcal{A}$, the statement of the exercise is implied by the fact that the composite $F\circ D\cl\mathcal{I}\to\mathcal{B}$ is again a covariant functor. This is shown in Exercise 1.15.

So $F(f)$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{D}$ and, moreover, $F(f^{-1})=F(f)^{-1}$.

Consider the finite category with two objects $a,b$ and only one non-identity morphism $f\cl a\to b$. Since there are no morphisms $b\to a$, $f$ is not an equivalence. The (unique) functor into the category $\mathbf{1}$ with a single object and a single morphism (namely, the identity on that object) maps $f$ to an equivalence.

Let $G$ be a group, and think of it as a category with one object, as in Exercise 1.3. Interpret functors $F \cl G \to \mathbf{Sets}$ in terms of familiar concepts in algebra.
\ex

\bs
A functor $F \cl G \to \mathbf{Sets}$ consists of a map $\{*\}\to \ob(\mathbf{Sets})$, i.e.\ a choice of a set $F(*)=X$, together with a map $F(g)\cl X\to X$ for each $g\in G$ such that $F(e)=\id_X$ (where $e$ is the identity of $G$) and $F(g\cdot h)=F(g)\circ F(h)$ for all $g,h\in G$. In other words, $F$ is the same as a $G$-set.

Explicitly, we get an action of $G$ on $X$ by defining 
\bi{rCl}
G\times X & \to & X\\
(g,x) & \mapsto & F(g)(x).

Let $i \cl S^1 \hookrightarrow D^2$ be the inclusion of the circle into the disk. An early success of algebraic topology concerned the existence of a continuous function $r \cl D^2 \to S^1$ such that the composite $r \circ i \cl S^1 \to S^1$ is the identity (in other words: is $S^1$ a retract of $D^2$?). The fundamental group is a covariant functor
\bse
\pi_1 \cl \mathbf{Top} \longrightarrow \mathbf{Grp}
\ese
from the category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces and continuous functions to the category $\mathbf{Grp}$ of groups and homomorphisms. You may have seen, and we will show later, that $\pi_1(S^1) = \Z$ and $\pi_1(D^2) = 0$. Using this functor, show that there can be no such function $r$.
\ep

\bs
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that such an $r\cl D^2\to S^1$ exists. Then $r\circ i=\id_{S^1}$, so $F(r)\circ F(i)=F(r\circ i)=F(\id_{S^1})=\id_{\Z}$. Thus we have the following commutative diagram in $\mathbf{Grp}$.

\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
\Z \ar[rr,bend left=40,"\id_{Z}"]\ar[r,"F(i)"']&0\ar[r,"F(r)"']&\Z
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
However, since $0$ is a zero object (see Exercise 1.43) in $\mathbf{Grp}$, the homomorphisms $F(i)$ and $F(r)$ are both trivial and hence $F(r)\circ F(i)$ cannot be the identity.

The commutativity of the diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ amounts to the equality of one or more composites $f_n\circ \cdots \circ f_1=g_m\circ \cdots \circ g_1\cl X\to Y$ between two objects $X,Y$ of the diagram. By functoriality, we have
\bse
F(f_1)\circ \cdots \circ F(f_n)=F(g_1)\circ \cdots \circ F(g_m)\cl FY\to FX,

so the corresponding diagram in $\mathcal{D}$ is also commutative.

F(f^{-1})\circ F(f)=F(f\circ f^{-1})=F(\id_Y)=\id_{FY}
\ese
and

F(f)\circ F(f^{-1})=F(f^{-1}\circ f)=F(\id_X)=\id_{FX}.

Show that the composite of two functors is a functor. What happens if one or both of the functors is contravariant?
\ex

\bs
Suppose first that $F\cl\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ and $G\cl\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{C}$ are both covariant. Define $G\circ F\cl\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{C}$ by setting $(G\circ F)A=G(FA)$ on objects and 
\bse
(G\circ F)(f\cl A \to B)=G(F(f)\cl FA\to FB)=GF(f)\cl GFA\to GFB
\ese
on morphisms. As $F$ and $G$ are functors, we have
\bse
(G\circ F)(\id_A)=G(F(\id_A))=G(\id_{FA})=\id_{GFA}
\ese
for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and, since they are both covariant,
\bse
(G\circ F)(g\circ f)=G(F(g\circ f))=G(F(g)\circ F(f))=G(F(g))\circ G(F(f))
\ese
for all morphisms $f,g$ in $\mathcal{A}$. So $G\circ F$ is again a covariant functor.

If $F$ is covariant and $G$ is contravariant, we have
\bse
(G\circ F)(f\cl A \to B)=G(F(f)\cl FA\to FB)=GF(f)\cl GFB\to GFA
\ese
and
\bse
(G\circ F)(g\circ f)=G(F(g\circ f))=G(F(g)\circ F(f))=G(F(f))\circ G(F(g))
\ese
while, if $F$ is contravariant and $G$ is covariant, we have
\bse
(G\circ F)(f\cl A \to B)=G(F(f)\cl FB\to FA)=GF(f)\cl GFB\to GFA
\ese
and
\bse
(G\circ F)(g\circ f)=G(F(g\circ f))=G(F(f)\circ F(g))=G(F(f))\circ G(F(g)).
\ese
Finally, if $F$ and $G$ are both contravariant, we have
\bse
(G\circ F)(f\cl A \to B)=G(F(f)\cl FB\to FA)=GF(f)\cl GFA\to GFB
\ese
and
\bse
(G\circ F)(g\circ f)=G(F(g\circ f))=G(F(f)\circ F(g))=G(F(g))\circ G(F(f)).

Thus, we see that $G\circ F$ is covariant if $F$ and $G$ have the same variance, and contravariant otherwise.

Can there be a functor $F \cl \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ that is both covariant and contravariant? What special properties must such a functor have?
\ex

\bs
Given $f\cl X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we require that $F(f)$ be both a morphism $FX\to FY$ and $FY\to FX$. This can only happen if $FX=FY$. Then, given $f\cl X\to Y$ and $g\cl Y\to Z$, we have $FX=FY=FZ$ and we also require $F(g)\circ F(f)=F(f)\circ F(g)$. So $F$ sends every morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ to an endomorphism in $\mathcal{D}$, such that composites of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ are sent to composites of commuting endomorphisms in $\mathcal{D}$.

For instance, if $G$ is an abelian group and $\mathcal{D}$ is the category obtained from $G$ as in Exercise 1.3 (b), then every functor $F\cl \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$ is both covariant and contravariant.
\es

Show that there is a universal example for contravariant functors out of a category $\mathcal{C}$. That is, show that there is a category $\mathcal{C}^\op$ and a contravariant functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^\op$ so that every other contravariant functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ has a unique factorization $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^\op \to \mathcal{D}$, where the functor $\mathcal{C}^\op \to\mathcal{D}$ is covariant.
\ex

\bs
Define $\mathcal{C}^\op$ by setting $\ob(\mathcal{C}^\op)=\ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mor_{\mathcal{C}^\op}(X,Y)=\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,X)$, for all $X,Y\in\ob(\mathcal{C}^\op)$. Define a functor $(-)^\op\cl \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C}^\op$ to be the identity on objects and by $(f\cl X\to Y)^\op=f^\op\cl Y\to X$ on morphisms. Note that $(\mathcal{C}^\op)^\op=\mathcal{C}$.

Let $F\cl \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$ be a contravariant functor and define $F'\cl\mathcal{C}^\op\to\mathcal{D}$ by $F'X=FX$ on objects and
\bse
F'(f^\op\cl Y\to X)=F(f\cl X\to Y)= F(f)\cl FY \to FX=F(f)\cl F'Y \to F'X
\ese
on morphisms, so that $F'$ is covariant. More succinctly, $F'=F\circ(-)^\op$. Then $F$ factors as $F=F'\circ(-)^\op$.

Now suppose that $G\cl \mathcal{C}^\op\to\mathcal{D}$ is another covariant functor such that $F=G\circ(-)^\op$. Then $F'X=FX=G(X^\op)=GX$ for all $X\in \mathcal{C}$ and, given any morphism $f\cl X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we have

F'(f^\op)=F(f)=(G\circ(-)^\op)(f)=G(f^\op),

so $F'=G$.

Consider the categories $\mathbf{AbGrp}$ of abelian groups (and homomorphisms) and $\mathbf{Sets}$ of sets (and functions). Since an abelian group is a set together with extra structure, we can define $F \cl \mathbf{AbGrp} \to\mathbf{Sets}$ by

We obviously have $F(\id_G)=\id_{FG}$ since the identity homomorphism is, in particular, the identity function on the underlying set of $G$. Similarly, $F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$ since the composite homomorphism of $f\cl G\to H$ and $g\cl H\to K$ is, in particular, the composite of the functions between the underlying sets of $G$, $H$ and $K$.

Try to make a formal definition of `forgetful functor'.
\ex

\bs
While there is no formal definition of the term `forgetful functor', it is frequently used to refer to functors which `forget' some structure or property in an obvious way. For instance, there are forgetful functors from $\mathbf{Grp}$, $\mathbf{Top}$, $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$, etc.\ to $\mathbf{Sets}$, as well as from $\mathbf{AbGrp}$ to $\mathbf{Grp}$, from $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$-$S$ to $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$, and so on.

It is often used in contrast with the term `free', so that if forgetful functors forget structure or properties, free functors add structure and properties in a canonical way, with minimal constraints. For example, we have a functor $F\cl \mathbf{Sets}\to\mathbf{Grp}$ which associates to each set $S$, the free group $F(S)$ generated by $S$; functors $I,D\cl \mathbf{Sets}\to\mathbf{Top}$ endowing sets with the trivial and discrete topology, respectively; the abelianisation functor $\mathbf{Grp}\to\mathbf{AbGrp}$ sending each group $G$ to $G/[G,G]$, the largest abelian quotient of $G$; etc.

\bi{rrCl}

First, note that, for all $\lambda,t_1,t_2\in\R$,

\Phi_V(v)(\lambda t_1+t_2) & = & (\lambda t_1+t_2)v\\

so that we indeed have $\Phi_V(v)\in\Hom_{\R}(\R,V)$, for all $v\in V$. Moreover,
\bi{rCl}
\Phi_V(\lambda v_1+v_2)(t) & = & t(\lambda v_1+v_2)\\
& = & \lambda tv_1+tv_2\\
& = & \lambda\Phi_V( v_1)(t)+\Phi_V(v_2)(t)\\
& = & (\lambda\Phi_V( v_1)+\Phi_V(v_2))(t)
\ei
for all $t\in\R$, so $\Phi_V(\lambda v_1+v_2)=\lambda\Phi_V( v_1)+\Phi_V(v_2)$ for all $\lambda \in \R$ and $v_1,v_2\in V$. Thus $\Phi_V$ itself is a linear transformation $V\to F(V)$.

Now define $\Psi_V\cl \Hom_{\R}(\R,V)\to V$ by $\Psi_V(f)=f(1)$. We have
\bi{rCl}
\Psi_V(\lambda f_1+f_2) & = & (\lambda f_1+f_2)(1)\\
& = & \lambda f_1(1)+f_2(1)\\
& = & \lambda\Psi_V( f_1)+\Psi_V(f_2)
\ei
for all $\lambda \in \R$ and $f_1,f_2\in\Hom_{\R}(\R,V)$, so $\Psi_V$ is a linear transformation $F(V)\to V$. Now let $v\in V$ and $f\in \Hom_{\R}(\R,V)$. Observe that
\bse
\Psi_V(\Phi_V(v))=\Phi_V(v)(1)=1v=v
\ese
and
\bse
\Phi_V(\Psi_V(f))(t)=\Phi_V(f(1))(t)=tf(1)=f(t) 
\ese
for all $t\in \R$, so $\Phi_V(\Psi_V(f))=f$. Thus $\Phi_V$ and $\Psi_V$ are inverse linear isomorphisms, and hence $V\cong F(V)$ for all $V\in \mathcal{V}$.

Now let $f\cl V\to W$ be a linear transformation and consider the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
\Hom_{\R}(\R,V) \ar[r,"f\circ -"] \ar[d,"\Psi_V"]& \Hom_{\R}(\R,W)\ar[d,"\Psi_W"]\\
V \ar[r,"f"]& W
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
For any $h\in\Hom_{\R}(\R,V)$, we have 
\bse
f(\Psi_V(h))=f(h(1))=(f\circ h)(1)=\Psi_W(f\circ h),
\ese
so the diagram commutes. Hence, the linear transformations $\Psi_V$ assemble into a natural transformation $\Theta\cl F \to \id_{\mathcal{V}}$, with $\Theta_V=\Psi_V$. Since each $\Psi_V$ has an inverse $\Phi_V$, we conclude that $\Theta\cl F \to \id_{\mathcal{V}}$ is a natural isomorphism.
\item Suppose that $V$ is finite dimensional, say $\dim V=n$. Thus $V$ admits a basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$. Define $f^1,\ldots,f^n\in\Hom_{\R}(V,\R)$ by requiring
\bse
f^i(e_j)=\delta^i_j=\begin{cases}1&\text{ if }i=j\\0&\text{ if }i\neq j\end{cases}

and extending linearly. Let $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\in\R$ and suppose that
\bse
\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_if^i=0.

Applying both sides to each $e_j$, for $1\leq j\leq n$, yields
\bse
0=\biggl(\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_if^i\biggr)e_j=\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_if^i(e_j)=\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\delta^i_j=\lambda_j.

So $\lambda_j=0$ for all $1\leq j\leq n$ and hence $\{f^1,\ldots,f^n\}$ is linearly independent.

Now let $h\in \Hom_{\R}(V,\R)$ and let $v=\sum_{i=1}^nv^ie_i\in V$. Then, noting that
\bse
f^j(v)=f^j\biggl(\sum_{i=1}^nv^ie_i\biggr)=\sum_{i=1}^nv^if^j(e_i)=\sum_{i=1}^nv^i\delta^j_i=v^j,
\ese
we have
\bse
h(v)=h\biggl(\sum_{i=1}^nv^ie_i\biggr)=\sum_{i=1}^nv^ih(e_i)=\sum_{i=1}^nf^i(v)h(e_i)=\biggl(\sum_{i=1}^nh(e_i)f^i\biggr)v,
\ese
so $h=\sum_{i=1}^nh(e_i)f^i$ and hence $\{f^1,\ldots,f^n\}$ is a basis of $\Hom_{\R}(V,\R)$.

Thus $V\cong \R^n\cong \Hom_{\R}(V,\R)$, so $V\cong G(V)$ for all finite-dimensional $V$.

Now observe that $G$ is a contravariant functor $\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}$ while $\id_{\mathcal{V}}$ is a covariant functor $\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}$. Natural transformations are only defined between functors of the same variance, so there are no natural transformations, much less natural isomorphisms, from $G$ to $\id_{\mathcal{V}}$.

There is, however, a sensible notion of a morphism $F\to G$ when $F$ and $G$ are of opposite variance, called a \emph{dinatural transformation}. Given functors $F,G\cl \mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ such that $F$ is covariant and $G$ is contravariant, a dinatural transformation $\Phi\cl F\to G$ consists in a collection of morphisms
\bse
\{\Phi_X\cl F(X)\to G(X)\mid X\in \mathcal{C}\}
\ese
in $\mathcal{D}$ such that, for each morphism $f\cl X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
F(X) \ar[d,"\Phi_X"]\ar[r,"F(f)"]& F(Y)\ar[d,"\Phi_Y"]\\
G(X) & \ar[l,"G(f)"]G(Y)
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commutes in $\mathcal{D}$, i.e.\ $\Phi_X=G(f)\circ\Phi_Y\circ F(f)$. A dinatural isomorphism is a dinatural transformation $\Phi$ in which each component map $\Phi_X$ is an isomorphism in $\mathcal{D}$. One can obviously reverse the direction of $F(f)$ and $G(f)$ when $F$ is contravariant and $G$ covariant.

The statement that $V$ is not canonically isomorphic to $\Hom_{\R}(V,\R)$ amounts to saying that there is no dinatural isomorphism $G\to \id_{\mathcal{V}}$. Indeed, suppose that there is a dinatural isomorphism $\Phi\cl G\to \id_{\mathcal{V}}$. Then, the square
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
\Hom_{\R}(V,\R)  \ar[d,"\Phi_V"]& \ar[l,"-\circ f"']\Hom_{\R}(W,\R)\ar[d,"\Phi_W"]\\
V \ar[r,"f"]& W
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commutes for any linear transformation $f\cl V\to W$. In particular, for the zero-transformation $0\cl V\to W$, we have
\bse
\Phi_W=0\circ\Phi_V\circ0=0,
\ese
so $\Phi_W$ cannot be an isomorphism (except when $W=0$). As this is true for all $W\in\mathcal{V}$, we conclude that the only dinatural transformation $G\to \id_{\mathcal{V}}$ is the zero-transformation, which is obviously not an isomorphism. Restricting to finite-dimensional vector spaces does not change the argument.

\begin{extrae}
Show how the problem: `decide whether $f \cl X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism' can be written in terms of extension and/or lifting problems.
\end{extrae}

\bs
The lifting problem for $h\cl Z\to Y$ and $f\cl X\to Y$ consists in finding a `lift' $\lambda\cl Z\to X$ such that $f\circ \lambda=h$. Let $Z=Y$ and $h=\id_Y$. Then the original lifting problem reduces to finding a map $\lambda\cl Y\to X$ such that the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
&& X\ar[d,"f"]\\
Y \ar[urr,bend left=10,"\lambda"] \ar[rr,"\id_Y"] & & Y
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commutes, i.e.\ $f\circ \lambda=\id_Y$. The dual extension problem consists in finding a map $\epsilon\cl Y\to X$ such that the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
&& \ar[dll,bend right=10,"\epsilon"'] Y\\
X  & & \ar[ll,"\id_X"'] X\ar[u,"f"']

commutes, i.e.\ $\epsilon\circ f=\id_X$.

Thus, $f\cl X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism if, and only if, there exists a map $g\cl Y\to X$ such that $g=\lambda=\epsilon$ solves both of the above problems.

\section{Products and Sums}

\bp
Suppose $X,Y\in \mathcal{C}$ and the objects $P$ and $Q$ are both products for $X$ and $Y$. Show that $P\cong Q$.
\ep

\bs
Since $P$ and $Q$ are products of $X$ and $Y$, there are two pairs of morphisms $X\xleftarrow{\ p_X}P\xrightarrow{\ p_Y}Y$ and $X\xleftarrow{\ q_X}Q\xrightarrow{\ q_Y}Y$ satisfying the universal property of a product. Then, by the universal properties of $P$ and $Q$, there are (unique) morphisms $f\cl P\to Q$ and $g\cl Q\to P$ making the diagrams
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large,row sep=large]

commute. This implies that the diagrams
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large,row sep=large]

\bi{rClcrCl}

p_Y\circ(g\circ f)&=&p_Y && q_Y\circ(f\circ g)&=&q_Y.
\ei
But by the universal properties of $P$ and $Q$, the unique morphisms $P\to P$ and $Q\to Q$ satisfying the above equations are $\id_P$ and $\id_Q$, respectively. Hence, $f$ and $g$ are equivalences.

\ei
By the universal property of the product, for each $(f,g)\in \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Z,X) \times \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Z, Y)$, there is a unique $h\in\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Z,X\times Y)$ such that $f=\pr_X\circ h$ and $g=\pr_Y\circ h$, i.e.\ such that $\phi(h)=(f,g)$. Existence amounts to surjectivity, and uniqueness implies injectivity. Then $\phi(h)=(f,g)$ if, and only if, $\pr_X\circ h=f$ and $\pr_Y\circ h=g$. 

In light of this bijection, we will write $(f,g)$ for the map $h=\phi^{-1}(f,g)$. With this notation, we have $\pr_X\circ(f,g)=f$ and $\pr_Y\circ(f,g)=g$.

is a product of $X\times Y$ and $Z$. Then it will follow that $(X\times Y)\times Z$ exists and, by the universal property, $X\times (Y\times Z)\cong (X\times Y)\times Z$.

Let $f\cl A\to X\times Y$ and $g\cl A\to Z$ be two morphisms. Then we have morphisms
\bi{rCl}
\pr_X'\circ f \cl && A \longrightarrow X\\
(\pr_Y'\circ f,g)\cl && A \longrightarrow Y\times Z

commute. Observe that
\bi{rCl}
(\pr_X,\pr_Y\circ\pr_{Y\times Z})\circ h & = & (\pr_X\circ h,\pr_Y\circ\pr_{Y\times Z}\circ h)\\
& = & (\pr_X'\circ f,\pr_Y\circ(\pr_Y'\circ f,g))\\

and 
\bi{rCl}
(\pr_Z\circ\pr_{Y\times Z})\circ h & = & \pr_Z\circ(\pr_{Y\times Z}\circ h)\\

That is, $h$ makes the diagram

\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large,row sep=large]

\ese
commute. We need to show that it is the unique such morphism. Let $\widetilde h\cl A \to X\times (Y\times Z)$ be another morphism making the above diagram commute, i.e.\
\bi{rCl}
(\pr_X,\pr_Y\circ\pr_{Y\times Z})\circ\widetilde h&=&f\\
(\pr_Z\circ\pr_{Y\times Z})\circ\widetilde h&=&g.
\ei
Then, as $f=(\pr_X'\circ f,\pr_Y'\circ f)$, we have $\pr_X\circ \widetilde h=\pr_X'\circ f$. Furthermore, $\pr_Y\circ\pr_{Y\times Z}\circ \widetilde h=\pr_Y'\circ f$ together with the second equation above, imply that $\pr_{Y\times Z}\circ \widetilde h=(\pr_Y'\circ f,g)$. Hence $\widetilde h$ also makes the earlier diagram commute. But $h$ is the unique morphism making that diagram commute and thus $\widetilde h=h$.

An entirely analogous argument shows that if $(X\times Y)\times Z$ exists, then so does $X\times (Y\times Z)$, and $(X\times Y)\times Z\cong X\times (Y\times Z)$.

\item Given $f\cl A\to X$ and $g\cl B\to Y$, we can form the morphisms

Then we can define $f\times g:=(f\circ\pr_A,g\circ\pr_B)$. Explicitly, $f\times g$ is the unique morphism making the following diagram commute.

Formulate precise definitions of the product $\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$ of two categories and of a functor of two variables.

\bs
We set $\ob(\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D})=\ob(\mathcal{C})\times\ob(\mathcal{D})$ and, for any $(A,B),(A',B')\in\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$,
\bse
\mor_{\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}}((A,B),(A',B'))=\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)\times \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(A',B').
\ese
That is, the objects and morphisms of $\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$ are pairs of objects and morphisms from $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$. We then have $\id_{(A,B)}=(\id_A,\id_B)$ and composition is defined componentwise.

In fact, for small categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ (i.e.\ such that $\ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $\ob(\mathcal{D})$ are sets), the product $\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$ thus defined is the categorical product (see Section 1.6) in $\mathbf{Cat}$, the category of small categories and functors.

A functor $F\cl\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{E}$ is called a functor of two variables, or bifunctor. A bifunctor is covariant (resp. contravariant) if, and only if, for all $A\in\mathcal{C}$ and $B\in\mathcal{D}$, the functors $F(A,-)\cl \mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{E}$ and $F(-,B)\cl \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{E}$ are both covariant (resp. contravariant). For example, the functor $-\times -\cl \mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}$ is covariant.

Additionally, we have the notion of a `mixed' bifunctor, which is a functor $F\cl\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{E}$ such that $F(A,-)\cl \mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{E}$ is covariant for all $A\in\mathcal{C}$, and $F(-,B)\cl \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{E}$ is contravariant for all $B\in\mathcal{D}$, or vice versa. Note that the functor $F(A,-)$ acts by $f\mapsto F(\id_A,f)$ on morphisms, and similarly for $F(-,B)$. An example of a functor of this kind is the hom-functor on $\mathcal{C}$, $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(-,-) \cl \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$, which is contravariant in the first variable and covariant in the second.

By the universal property of the coproduct, for each $(f,g)\in \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,B) \times \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Y, B)$, there is a unique $h\in\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X\sqcup Y,B)$ such that $f= h\circ \inj_X$ and $g=h\circ \inj_Y$, i.e.\ such that $\psi(h)=(f,g)$. Existence amounts to surjectivity, and uniqueness implies injectivity. Then $\psi(h)=(f,g)$ if, and only if, $h\circ\inj_X=f$ and $h\circ\inj_Y=g$. 

Using the notation $(f,g)$ for the map $h=\psi^{-1}(f,g)$, we have $(f,g)\circ\inj_X=f$ and $(f,g)\circ\inj_Y=g$.

\section{Initial and Terminal Objects}

\bx
Find initial and terminal objects in the following contexts.
\ben[label=(\alph*)]
\item The category $\mathbf{Sets}$ of sets and functions.
\item The category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces and continuous functions.
\item The category $\mathbf{Grp}$ of groups and group homomorphisms.

\ex

\bs
\ben[label=(\alph*)]
\item Given any set $X$, there is a unique map $\vn \to X$. 

Indeed, if a function $f\cl A\to B$ is defined to be a subset $f\subseteq A\times B$ such that for all $a\in A$ there is a unique $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in f$, then clearly $\vn \subseteq \vn \times X=\vn$ satisfies this condition vacuously for any $X$ (including the case $\vn\to\vn$) and it is the unique subset of $\vn$.

So $\vn$ is an initial object of $\mathbf{Sets}$ and, in fact, the unique such.
Note, however, that there is no function $Y\to \vn$ for non-empty $Y$ since the above existence condition fails. Hence $\vn$ cannot be a terminal object.

Instead, a terminal object of $\mathbf{Sets}$ is any singleton $\{x\}$ as, given any other set $Y$, there is a unique map $Y\to \{x\}$, namely, the constant map with value $x$. Of course, there are infinitely many terminal objects in $\mathbf{Sets}$, but since there is a unique map between any two singletons which is, obviously, a bijection, the terminal object of $\mathbf{Sets}$ is unique up to unique isomorphism.
\item The empty space $\vn$ with its unique topology $\{\vn\}$ is such that the unique map $\vn\to X$ to any topological space $X$ is continuous. So $(\vn,\{\vn\})$ is the (unique) initial object in $\mathbf{Top}$.

Similarly, any one-point space $P$ with its unique topology $\{\vn,P\}$ is such that the unique map $Y\to P$ for any topological space $Y$ is continuous. So $(P,\{\vn,P\})$ is a terminal object of $\mathbf{Top}$.

\item The trivial group $\{e\}$ in $\mathbf{Grp}$, which is unique up to unique group isomorphism, is a zero object of $\mathbf{Grp}$, i.e.\ it is both initial and terminal.    
Indeed, given any other group $G$, there is a unique homomorphism $G\to \{e\}$ (the unique set function $G\to \{e\}$) and a unique homomorphism $\{e\} \to G$, i.e.\ the function mapping $e$ to the identity element of $G$.

Verify that $\mathbf{Sets_*}$ is a pointed category. What is a sum in $\mathbf{Sets_*}$? What is a product?
\ex

\bs
Any pointed singleton $(\{x\},x)$ is a zero object of $\mathbf{Sets_*}$. Indeed, given any other pointed set $(Y,y)$, there is a unique pointed map $(Y,y)\to(\{x\},x)$ (the unique map $Y\to \{x\}$) and a unique pointed map $(\{x\},x)\to (Y,y)$ sending $x\mapsto y$.

The sum of $(X,x_0)$ and $(Y,y_0)$ in $\mathbf{Sets _*}$ is $(X\sqcup Y/\{x_0,y_0\},[x_0]=[y_0])$ with the usual injections, while their product is $(X\times Y,(x_0,y_0))$ with the usual projections. Indeed, given any pointed maps $f\cl(X,x_0)\to(Z,z_0)$ and $g\cl(Y,y_0)\to(Z,z_0)$, there is a unique map $h\cl X\sqcup Y\to Z$ such that $h\circ\inj_X=f$ and $h\circ\inj_Y=g$. Then, in particular, 
\bse
h(x_0)=h(\inj_X(x_0))=f(x_0)=z_0=g(y_0)=h(\inj_Y(y_0))=h(y_0).
\ese
So $h$ is, in fact, a well-defined pointed map $(X\sqcup Y/\{x_0,y_0\},[x_0])\to(Z,z_0)$, and the unique such making the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
(X,x_0) \ar[dr,"f"']\ar[r,"\inj_X"] & \bigl(\frac{X\sqcup Y}{\{x_0,y_0\}},[x_0]\bigr) \ar[d,dashed,"h"] & \ar[l,"\inj_Y"'](Y,y_0)\ar[dl,"g"]\\
&(Z,z_0)&
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commute. Dually, given any pointed maps $f\cl(Z,z_0)\to(X,x_0)$ and $g\cl(Z,z_0)\to(Y,y_0)$, there is a unique map $h\cl Z\to X\times Y$ such that $\pr_X\circ h=f$ and $\pr_Y\circ h=g$. Then, in particular, 
\bse
\pr_X(h(z_0))=f(z_0)=x_0 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \pr_Y(h(z_0))=g(z_0)=y_0,
\ese
so $h(z_0)=(x_0,y_0)$. Thus $h$ is indeed the unique pointed map making the following diagram commute.
\bse

Finally, the universal property of the product $P$ implies that there exists a unique morphism $t\cl Z \to P$ making the two triangles commute.
\item Dually, let $\iota$ be an initial object of $\mathcal{C}$ and let $C$ be a coproduct of $X$ and $Y$. Then $C$ solves the problem expressed in the diagram

\item Recall from Exercise 1.34 that there is a bijection
\bse
\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,X\times Y)  \cong \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,X) \times \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Y) .
\ese
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is pointed, $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Y)$ is non-empty for all $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$ as any two objects are connected by the zero map $*$. We can thus define $\ax_X\cl X\to X\times Y$ to be the morphism corresponding to $(\id_X,*)$ under the bijection. Similarly, we define $\ax_Y=(*,\id_Y)$.
\item By the bijection
\bse
\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A\lor B,A\times B) \cong\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,A\times B) \times \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B,A\times B),
\ese
there is a unique morphism
\bse
w\cl A\lor B\to A\times B
\ese
corresponding to the pair $(\ax_{A},\ax_{B})$. Note that we have
\bi{rCl}
\pr_{A}\circ w\circ\inj_{A} & = & \pr_{A}\circ (\ax_{A},\ax_{B})\circ\inj_{A}\\
& = & \pr_{A}\circ \ax_{A}\\
& = & \pr_{A}\circ(\id_{A},*)\\
& = & \id_{A}
\ei
and, similarly,
\bi{rCl}
\pr_{A}\circ w\circ\inj_{B} & = & *\\
\pr_{B}\circ w\circ\inj_{A} & = & *\\
\pr_{B}\circ w\circ\inj_{B} & = & \id_{B}.
\ei
Thus, we know that every section in the following diagram commutes, except possibly the middle square.
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
\ar[ddd,bend right=70,"\id_{A}"'] A \ar[d,"\inj_{A}"']\ar[r,"f"] & X\ar[d,"\inj_{X}"]\ar[ddd,bend left=70,"\id_{X}"]\\

A\ar[r,"f"] & X
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
There are similar diagrams in which one or both of the top and bottom maps is replaced by $g\cl B\to Y$, with the appropriate projections and/or injections. Using the commutativity of these diagrams (minus the middle squares), we have
\bse
\pr_X\circ w \circ (f\lor g) \circ \inj_A = \pr_X\circ w \circ\inj_X\circ f=\id_X\circ f=f
\ese
and
\bse
\pr_X\circ (f\times g) \circ w \circ  \inj_A =  f\circ \pr_A\circ w \circ\inj_A=f\circ \id_A=f.
\ese
Similarly, we have
\bse
\pr_X\circ w \circ (f\lor g) \circ \inj_B  = * = \pr_X\circ (f\times g) \circ w \circ  \inj_B
\ese
together with the corresponding results
\bi{rCcCl}
\pr_Y\circ w \circ (f\lor g) \circ \inj_B  & = & g & = & \pr_Y\circ (f\times g) \circ w \circ  \inj_B\\
\pr_Y\circ w \circ (f\lor g) \circ \inj_A  & = & * & = & \pr_Y\circ (f\times g) \circ w \circ  \inj_A.
\ei
By the universal property of coproducts, there are unique maps $r\cl A\lor B\to X$ and $s\cl A\lor B\to Y$ making the diagrams
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
A \ar[dr,"f"']\ar[r,"\inj_A"]& A\lor B \ar[d,dashed,"s"]&\ar[l,"\inj_B"'] B\ar[dl,"*"]\\

\end{tikzcd}

\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
A \ar[dr,"*"']\ar[r,"\inj_A"]& A\lor B \ar[d,dashed,"r"]&\ar[l,"\inj_B"'] B\ar[dl,"g"]\\
& Y &
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commute. Since both $\pr_X\circ w \circ (f\lor g)$ and $\pr_X\circ (f\times g) \circ w$ make the left diagram commute, and both $\pr_Y\circ w \circ (f\lor g)$ and $\pr_Y\circ (f\times g) \circ w$ make the right diagram commute, we must have
\bse
\pr_X\circ w \circ (f\lor g)=s=\pr_X\circ (f\times g) \circ w
\ese
and
\bse
\pr_Y\circ w \circ (f\lor g)=r=\pr_Y\circ (f\times g) \circ w.
\ese
Then, by the universal property of products, there is a unique map $h\cl A\lor B\to X\times Y$ making the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
&A\lor B\ar[dl,"s"']\ar[d,dashed,"h"]\ar[dr,"r"]&\\
X & \ar[l,"\pr_Y"]X\times Y \ar[r,"\pr_X"']& Y
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commute. Since, as we have just shown, both $w \circ (f\lor g)$ and $(f\times g) \circ w$ make the diagram commute, we must indeed have
\bse
w \circ (f\lor g)=h=(f\times g) \circ w.
\ese

{\scshape Note}. Of course, we could equally well have invoked the universal property of products first to deduce that
\bse
w \circ (f\lor g)\circ \inj_A=(f\times g) \circ w\circ \inj_A
\ese
and
\bse
w \circ (f\lor g)\circ \inj_B=(f\times g) \circ w\circ \inj_B,
\ese
and then used the universal property of coproducts to conclude the proof.

The reason why we need $\mathcal{C}$ to be pointed before we can define $w$ is that, under the bijection of Exercise 1.34, the map $\ax_X\cl X\to X\times Y$ must correspond to a pair of maps, one $X\to X$ and the other $X\to Y$. But, in general, there is no reason why there should be a morphism $X\to Y$ between any two distinct objects $X$ and $Y$.

\item Under the bijection $\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X\lor Y,Z) \cong\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Z) \times \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Y, Z)$, setting $Z=X$ and $Z=Y$, we define the `collapse' maps $\co_X\cl X\lor Y\to X$ and $\co_Y\cl X\lor Y\to Y$ by $\co_X=(\id_X,*)$ and $\co_Y=(*,\id_Y)$, respectively.

If $X$ is a set, then we can form the free abelian group $F(X) = \bigoplus_{x\in X} \Z$. On the other hand, if $G$ is an abelian group, then we can forget the group structure of $G$ and just remember the underlying set $S(G)$.

\item Show that the functors $F \cl \mathbf{Sets} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ and $S \cl \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Sets}$ are adjoint to one another. Which is the left adjoint and which is the right adjoint?

Problem 1.74 shows that the maps $L$ and $\sigma_*$ are equivalent maps. In Section 1.2 we defined what equivalence means in categorical terms---what category are we working in here?

Let $L \cl \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and $R \cl\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ be a pair of adjoint functors. Show that there are natural maps $X \to RLX$ and $LRX \to X$ and that $RX$ is naturally a retract of $RLRX$.
\ep

\begin{extrap}
Show that if $L, L' \cl \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ are both left adjoints to $R \cl \mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{C}$, then there is a natural isomorphism $L \to L'$. So adjoints are unique up to isomorphism.
\end{extrap}

\bs
For $A\in \mathcal{C}$ and $B\in\mathcal{D}$, denote by $\Phi_{A,B}\cl\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,B)\to\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RB)$ and $\Psi_{A,B}\cl\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,B)\to\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RB)$ the natural bijections corresponding to the adjunctions $L\dashv R$ and $L'\dashv R$, respectively.

For each $A\in \mathcal{C}$, define $\xi_A=(\Psi_{A,LA})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LA}(\id_{LA}))$, i.e.\ $\xi_A$ is the image of $\id_{LA}$ under the composite
\bse
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,LA)\xrightarrow{\ \Phi_{A,LA} \ }\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RLA)\xrightarrow{\ (\Psi_{A,LA})^{-1}\ }\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,LA).
\ese
Then $\xi\cl L'\to L$ is a natural isomorphism. To see this, let $f\cl A\to B$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$. We seek to show that the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=large]
L'A \ar[r,"\xi_A"]\ar[d,"L'f"] & LA\ar[d,"Lf"]\\
L'B\ar[r,"\xi_B"]&LB
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
commutes. Consider the following diagram:
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge,column sep=4.5em]
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,LA) \ar[r,"\Phi_{A,LA}"]\ar[d,"Lf\circ-"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RLA)\ar[r,"(\Psi_{A,LA})^{-1}"] \ar[d,"RLf\circ-"]& \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,LA)\ar[d,"Lf\circ-"]\\
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,LB) \ar[r,"\Phi_{A,LB}"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RLB)\ar[r,"(\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}"] & \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,LB)
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
The internal squares commute by the assumption that we have adjunctions $L\dashv R$ and $L'\dashv R$. Hence, so does the outer rectangle. Following $\id_{LA}$ around the diagram, we obtain
\bi{rCl}
Lf\circ\xi_A & = & (\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LB}(Lf\circ\id_{LA}))\\
& = & (\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LB}(Lf\circ L(\id_{A})))\\
& = & (\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LB}(L(f\circ\id_{A})))\\
& = & (\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LB}(L(f))).
\ei
Similarly, by considering the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge,column sep=4.5em]
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LB,LB) \ar[r,"\Phi_{B,LB}"]\ar[d,"-\circ Lf"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B,RLB)\ar[r,"(\Psi_{B,LB})^{-1}"] \ar[d,"-\circ f"]& \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'B,LB)\ar[d,"-\circ L'f"]\\
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,LB) \ar[r,"\Phi_{A,LB}"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RLB)\ar[r,"(\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}"] & \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,LB)
\end{tikzcd}
\ese
we find
\bi{rCl}
\xi_B\circ L'f & = & (\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LB}(\id_{LB}\circ Lf))\\
& = & (\Psi_{A,LB})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LB}(Lf)).
\ei
So $Lf\circ\xi_A=\xi_B\circ L'f$, i.e.\ $\xi$ is a natural transformation.

Finally, for each $A\in \mathcal{C}$, define $\lambda_A=(\Phi_{A,L'A})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,L'A}(\id_{L'A}))$, i.e.\ $\lambda_A$ is the image of $\id_{L'A}$ under the composite
\bse
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,L'A)\xrightarrow{\ \Psi_{A,L'A} \ }\mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RL'A)\xrightarrow{\ (\Phi_{A,L'A})^{-1}\ }\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,L'A).
\ese
By the naturality of the bijections $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, the diagram
\bse
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge,column sep=4.5em]
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,L'A) \ar[r,"\Psi_{A,L'A}"]\ar[d,"\xi_A\circ-"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RL'A)\ar[r,"(\Phi_{A,L'A})^{-1}"] \ar[d," R\xi_A\circ-"]& \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,L'A)\ar[d,"\xi_A\circ-"]\\
\mor_{\mathcal{D}}(L'A,LA) \ar[r,"\Psi_{A,LA}"]& \mor_{\mathcal{C}}(A,RLA)\ar[r,"(\Phi_{A,LA})^{-1}"] & \mor_{\mathcal{D}}(LA,LA)
\end{tikzcd}
\ese

commutes. Chasing $\id_{L'A}$ around the diagram, we obtain
\bi{rCl}
\xi_A\circ\lambda_A & = & (\Phi_{A,LA})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,LA}(\xi_A\circ \id_{L'A}))\\
& = & (\Phi_{A,LA})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,LA}(\xi_A))\\
& = &  (\Phi_{A,LA})^{-1}(\Psi_{A,LA}(\Psi_{A,LA})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LA}(\id_{LA})))\\
& = &  (\Phi_{A,LA})^{-1}(\Phi_{A,LA}(\id_{LA}))\\
& = &\id_{LA}
\ei
and, similarly, $\lambda_A\circ\xi_A=\id_{L'A}$ for each $A\in \mathcal{C}$. So $\xi_A$ is an isomorphism for each $A\in\mathcal{C}$, and thus $\xi\cl L'\to L$ is a natural isomorphism with inverse $\lambda$.
