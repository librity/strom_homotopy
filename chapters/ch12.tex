Show that the free product of two groups is very poorly named: it is the sum in the category of groups.
\ex

\bs
Consider the free product $A*B$, defined as the free group on $A\sqcup B$ subject to the relations already present in $A$ and $B$, and with $e_A$ and $e_B$ identified. Its elements are words of the form $a_1^{k_1}b_1^{k_2}\cdots a_n^{k_{n-1}}b_n^{k_{2n}}$ with $a_1,\ldots,a_n\in A$, $b_1,\ldots,b_n\in B$, and $k_1,\ldots,k_{2n}\in \Z$. Define $i_A\cl A \to A*B$ and $i_B\cl B\to A*B$ by sending $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ to the one-letter words $a$ and $b$, respectively.

Let $D$ be a group and let $j_A\cl A\to D$ and $j_B\cl B\to D$ be group homomorphisms. Define a map $\phi\cl A*B\to D$ by
\bse
\phi(a_1^{k_1}b_1^{k_2}\cdots a_n^{k_{2n-1}}b_n^{k_{2n}}):=j_A(a_1^{k_1})j_B(b_1^{k_2})\cdots j_A(a_n^{k_{2n-1}})j_B(b_n^{k_{2n}}).
\ese
Since $j_A$ and $j_B$ are group homomorphisms, so is $\phi$. Furthermore, for each $a\in A$, we have
\bse
\phi\circ i_A(a)=j_A(a),
\ese
so $\phi\circ i_A=j_A$ and, similarly, $\phi\circ i_B=j_B$. 
Finally, suppose that $\psi\cl A*B\to D$ is a group homomorphism such that $\psi\circ i_A=j_A$ and $\psi\circ i_B=j_B$. Then
\bi{rCl}
\psi(a_1^{k_1}b_1^{k_2}\cdots a_n^{k_{2n-1}}b_n^{k_{2n}}) & = &\psi(a_1)^{k_1}\psi(b_1)^{k_2}\cdots \psi(a_n)^{k_{2n-1}}\psi(b_n)^{k_{2n}}\\
& = &\psi(i_A(a_1))^{k_1}\psi(i_B(b_1))^{k_2}\cdots \psi(i_A(a_n))^{k_{2n-1}}\psi(i_B(b_n))^{k_{2n}}\\
& = & j_A(a_1)^{k_1}j_B(b_1)^{k_2}\cdots j_A(a_n)^{k_{2n-1}}j_B(b_n)^{k_{2n}}\\
&=&\phi(a_1^{k_1}b_1^{k_2}\cdots a_n^{k_{2n-1}}b_n^{k_{2n}}).
\ei
So $\psi=\phi$ and hence $(A*B,i_A,i_B)$ is a co-product of $A$ and $B$.
